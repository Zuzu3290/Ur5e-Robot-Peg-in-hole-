# UR5E Robot Peg-in-Hole Simulation

This repository contains the simulation environment and associated scripts for studying the **peg-in-hole task using the UR5E robotic arm**. The primary goal of this project is to understand and analyze the robot’s behavior during peg insertion under various simulation conditions and algorithms.

## Repository Structure

### Articulation Joints
Contains scripts and configuration files for simulating the robot’s articulated joints. These files define the dynamics, kinematics, and control methods applied to the UR5E in the simulation.

### Joint Force Plot
Includes two files that visualize the forces acting on the robot’s joints, as well as readings from contact sensors. These plots help assess the quality and stability of the robot’s interactions during peg insertion.

### Images / Descriptive Media
Additional images and visualizations illustrate the dynamic behavior of the robot during simulation, providing a clear representation of peg-in-hole manipulation and performance outcomes.

## Purpose

This repository is intended to demonstrate **robot simulation behavior**, highlighting the effects of various algorithms and dynamics on the UR5E’s performance. It provides a framework to explore, test, and analyze robotic manipulation tasks in a controlled simulation environment.
